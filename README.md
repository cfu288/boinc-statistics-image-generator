# BOINC statistics image generator

Fetch a user's BOINC statistics from multiple projects and generate a banner png with the user's contribution statistics. The image can be used in forum signatures or anywhere else where an html img tag is used.

Combine with Github Actions cron to automatically generate new stats on a schedule without the need of a BOINC aggregator.

Example:
